## üìñ About The Project

This tool utilizes public data to analyze and locate sports facilities across New York City. When a user enters a location (address or zipcode) and a desired sport, the navigator finds the five nearest public facilities.

This navigator was created based on my personal experiences after moving to NYC. It is designed to be useful for people searching for new hobbies, as well as for those who have recently relocated to New York, helping them easily find the sports facilities they're looking for.

*(This navigator was developed with the help of generative AI.)*
